# Basic implementation

This is a basic solar system implementation, based on the blog posts [here](https://www.cyber-omelette.com/2016/11/python-n-body-orbital-simulation.html) and [here](https://www.cyber-omelette.com/2017/02/RK4.html) but written to use numpy arrays as vectors, with the goal of eventually using numba to improve the performance.
